## Project name: 
#### Reviewing and Analyzing Social Injustice Problems behind Application of Machine Learning Techniques: A Practical Case on COMPAS

## Contributor: Yue Hao

## Abstract:
    It aims at exploring the hidden racial discrimination of a recidivism prediction algorithm named: Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS). A logistic regression model was used to check the capability of a simple machine learning algorithm comparing to the sophisticated COMPAS counterpart.
